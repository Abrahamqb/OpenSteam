# OpenSteam

**OpenSteam** is an open-source and secure alternative inspired by tools like SteamTools.
It focuses on safety, transparency, and performance, offering a fast and efficient user experience.

OpenSteam includes built-in Millennium installation and an integrated **Lua Store**, allowing you to download and manage Lua scripts **without relying on external websites**.
It also features a **manual installation section**, so you can install scripts that are not available in the store.

## How to Use

First, patch Steam and restart it. Then choose one of the following methods to add games:

**Manual Lua (LuaLoader):** Download the Lua file from an external website such as
Openlua.cloud or fares.top and load it manually.

**Lua Store (official, free):** Enter the Steam game ID (find it on SteamDB) and click
the button. The game will be added to your account instantly.

**Millennium + KernelLua (recommended):** Install Millennium — OpenSteam automates this —
then activate the plugin to add games natively from Steam.

> **Important:** After patching, adding, or removing a game, you must restart Steam for
> the changes to take effect. You can restart manually or use the designated button in the app.
